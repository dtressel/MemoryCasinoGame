        The goal of Memory Casino Game is to find the matching pairs in the dealt cards.
        Based on the game difficulty that you choose, 10, 16, or 22 cards will be placed
        face-down on the table.<br><br>By using two decks of cards, each card will have an exact
        match placed somewhere on the table. Bet a dollar amount per turn to turn two 
        cards of your choosing. If those two cards match, the cards will remain face-up. 
        If the two cards don't match, both cards will be turned back over. Once you have
        found all pairs, the game will end.<br><br>For each pair that you match, you will win a
        bonus. The amount won per matched pair are calculated based on the game difficulty 
        and the type of card matched. The higher the difficulty the higher the bonuses. 
        Also, within each game type, the Ace of Spades pair has the highest bonus, followed 
        by the rest of the Aces, followed by the face cards, and finally, followed by the 
        number cards, which recieve the lowest bonus. If you run out of money during a game, 
        you bust and the game is over!

    <!-- About Screen: -->

    <h3 class="about-screen element-off">About the Creator:</h3>
    <p class="about-screen element-off">
        Memory Casino Game was created by Daniel Tressel. 
        This is one of the first exercises that he had to do for the Springboard software 
        Engineering Bootcamp that he's currently taking part in. This exercise is supposed 
        to be a simple memory matching game with basic functionality, but he decided 
        to add some spice and turn it into a casino game. Daniel wanted to challenge himself 
        and see how much he can do in the alotted time for this exercise. He went a bit overboard, 
        but, nonetheless, he hopes that you enjoy the game. In addition to being a software 
        egineer, Daniel is a professional classical cellist and composer. He's kept busy by his 
        two-year old daughter and plays chess competetively for fun.
